# HealthNote-Relay Active Context

## Current Work Focus
We are expanding our HealthNote-Relay implementation to support NIP-101e (Workout Events) while preparing for a more modular approach to health and fitness data on Nostr. This integration extends our existing relay and Blossom node architectures to handle exercise templates, workout templates, and workout records with privacy-aware routing.

## Recent Changes
- Added support for NIP-101e workout event kinds (1301, 33401, 33402) to relay and Blossom node
- Enhanced the privacy classification system to handle workout events with appropriate defaults
- Added PostgreSQL indices for efficient workout data queries
- Added specialized LevelDB indices in Blossom node for workout data
- Expanded client SDK with interfaces and methods for workout data management
- Created type definitions for Exercise Templates, Workout Templates, and Workout Records

## Active Tasks
1. Testing the NIP-101e implementation across relay, Blossom node, and client SDK
2. Preparing for the modular health and fitness NIPs approach
3. Implementing reference handling between health metrics and workout data
4. Enhancing the client SDK with more granular privacy controls
5. Improving the workout data visualization capabilities

## Next Steps
1. Fix TypeScript linter errors in the client SDK implementation
2. Implement GPS/route data handling for workouts with location information
3. Add support for split data in running workouts (as proposed in the pull request comments)
4. Create examples of health metric references inside workout records
5. Implement specialized API endpoints for workout data queries
6. Prepare documentation for NIP-101e integration

## Active Decisions
- **Privacy Defaults**: Defining sensible privacy defaults for different workout event types
- **Reference Handling**: Determining how to efficiently handle references between events
- **Schema Evolution**: Planning for forward compatibility with future health NIPs
- **Data Validation**: Establishing validation rules for workout data structure
