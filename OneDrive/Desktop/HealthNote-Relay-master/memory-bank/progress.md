# HealthNote-Relay Progress

## Current Status
The project has evolved from basic implementation to now supporting NIP-101e (Workout Events) and preparing for an ultra-modular approach to health and fitness data on Nostr. Major components have been enhanced to support exercise templates, workout templates, and workout records while maintaining privacy-aware routing.

## What Works
- Project structure fully defined with comprehensive Memory Bank
- BlossomAwareRelay with privacy classification for both health and workout events
- PostgreSQL storage adapter with optimized schema and workout-specific indices
- Blossom node WebSocket implementation with LevelDB storage and workout data indexing
- Client SDK with specialized methods for workout data management
- Privacy-aware routing between main relay and Blossom nodes
- Basic health event and workout data publishing and querying functionality

## In Progress
- NIP-101e integration testing across all components
- Enhanced workout data query capabilities
- Client SDK error handling and retry mechanisms
- Reference handling between health metrics and workout records
- Data validation for workout events

## To Be Implemented
- Extended workout capabilities (GPS tracks, splits, performance metrics)
- Social features (challenges, achievements, comparative metrics)
- Complete integration with the ultra-modular NIPs approach
- Support for additional specific health metrics (heart rate, VO2max, etc.)
- Administration dashboard
- Performance optimization
- Documentation expansion

## Known Issues
- TypeScript linter errors in client SDK implementation
- Dockerfiles need to be tested in a multi-container environment
- WebSocket connections need more robust error handling
- Forward compatibility with future NIPs needs more planning
- Reference handling between events needs optimization
